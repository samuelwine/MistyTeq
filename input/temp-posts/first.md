Title: So what is a Server??

Fortunately, the concept of a server is very simple.

Your regular home computer does many different things. It does word processing, it can send emails, it allows you to place online orders, and much much more.

Everything that your home computer does is only because you have told the computer to do it. It sends emails because you told it to and it does spreadsheet calculations because you told it to. Never will your computer take instructions from someone external, over the internet for example. If someone over the internet tried to issue instruction to your computer, it would totally ignore them.

Why is that? Why does your computer take instructions from you, but not from an external person over the internet?

Dead simple. Your computer doesn't know how to respond to external commands. No one has ever told it how to.

Computers only know how to do things if they have clear instructions. These instructions are called software.

The software on your computer instructs your computer how to respond to your commands, but there's nothing in there about how to respond to anyone else.

Supposing your computer **does** have software on it that tells it how to respond to commands from the internet. You might change how you view your computer. You may look at it not as your own personal computer anymore, but as a service provider to the world. Anyone anywhere can issue commands, and your computer, as the service provider, will carry out those commands.

"Service Provider" is a bit of a mouthful.... so for short its called.... a server!

Honestly - that's all a server is. Its just a regular computer, that has instructions (aka software) how to respond to commands from internet users.

So why is there this thing that servers are super-powerful?

There's a simple reason for that.

Have you ever (I'm sure you have) asked your computer to do too many things in one go and it just froze? We've all done that and there's many different ways to react. You can shout and scream, you can beg, you can stomp away in a rage, none of which has any effect on the overworked computer.

That's kindof ok with your personal computer, you give it a minute or two and it normally gets back to itself. Supposing though your business clients were attempting to connect to your website, and your server gets overloaded, and they have to wait a minute or two for your server to be available.... Not good.

Solution?? - Get a super-powerful computer, install server software on it so that it knows how to respond to external commands, and with its unlimited power, it'll handle hundreds of requests simultaneously without batting an eyelid.

The more internet traffic you're expecting your server to handle, the more powerful you'll want it to be.

So servers do not by definition have to be powerful, but due to the work you're expecting them to do, you'll sure want it to have some serious muscle.
